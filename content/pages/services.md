Title: Services

Tuzig takes on small projects and medium-term engagments. Engagements
start with a three months development contract.  While under contract
Benny will join the dev team and help it grow through code commits and
improvments to the devlopment process.

After the initial contract the client can choose to extend the contract
by up to three months. 

Small, price-fixed projects are for non-profit organizations that look for an
open-data, open-source online solution. In these projects Benny takes full
responsibility over the projects' design, development and deployment
of the project.
