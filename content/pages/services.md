Title: Services

Tuzig offers two kinds of service:

Just Code
=========
Benny will use his craft to commit Python and
JavaScript code. We are most experienced with Django and AngularJS
and we're happy to learn new tools. The client is expected to maintain a
well organized
[Kanaban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) to ease
communications.

Building a Fire
===============
Benny will lead a software project and deliver a few iterations.

The client needs to provide a short product
description and introductions to its stakeholders. We start by meeting the
stakeholders, writing a spec, get stakeholders'
approval, design the software architecture and UI, write the tests, code
and documentation and manage the entire cycle.

While Benny can do it all by himself, we prefer to work
with in-house specialists tapping into their knowledge and ensuring a
smooth transition as we phase out.

Prehistory

co-founded and led as CEO in its first 7 years. Now part of HP,
Shunra's first product was released in Mid 1998 - a WAN emulator called "The Cloud".
Here is [Shunra's site](/shunra1) from back then.
