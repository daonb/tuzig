Title: Services

Tuzig offer two kinds of service:

Just Code
=========
While under contract, Benny will use his craft to commit Python and
JavaScript code. We have the most experience with Django and AngularJS
and we're happy to learn new tools. The client is expect to maintain a
well organized [Kanaban](http://kanbanblog.com/explained/).

Building a Fire
===============
While under contract, Benny will lead software projects and
deliver a few iterations.

The client needs to provide a short product
description and introductions to its stakeholders. We start by meeting the
stakeholders, writing a spec, get stakeholders'
approval, design the software architecture and UI, write the tests, code
and documentation and manage the entire cycle.

While Benny can do it all by himself, we prefer to work
with in-house specialists tapping into their knowledge and ensuring a
smooth transition as we phase out.
