Title: Services

Tuzig's main service is taking ownership of new software projects and
delivering their first few iterations.

Our biggest value is when we help with that important
project your R&D team never gets around to develop. All we need is a short product
description and introductions to the stakeholders. We start by meeting the
stakeholders, writing a spec, get stakeholders'
approval, design the software architecture and UI, write the tests, code
and documentation and manage the entire cycle.

While Benny can do it all by himself, we prefer to work
with in-house specialists tapping into their knowledge and ensuring a
smooth transition as we phase out.

We are not cheap, but we do deliver solid software products with minimal
management overhead. If you're interested please send Benny an email at
bennydaon at gmail dot com.
