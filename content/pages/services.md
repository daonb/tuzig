Title: Services

We like to take that important
software project an organization never gets around to develop and turn in into
a working, cheap to maintain code base. All we need is a short product
description and introductions to the product's stakeholders.

We start by meeting the stakeholders, write a spec, get stakeholders'
approval, design the software architecture and UI, write the tests, code
and documentation and manage the entire cycle.

While Benny can do it all by himself, we prefer to work
with in-house specialists tapping into their knowledge and ensuring a
smooth transition as we phase out.

We are not cheap, but we do deliver solid software products with minimal
management overhead. If you're interested please send me an email at
bennydaon at gmail dot com.
