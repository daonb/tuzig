Title: Services

I am a software craftsman who understands agile development and the
importance of automated testing and documentation.  I am a "full stack" meaning I am good at coding a frontend using frameworks like AngularJS, and I can code DevOps tools based on tools like Docker.
I love Python and Javascript and know very little about SQL and a lot about data networks.

While I prefer to code, I can also lead from the top, using emails and
 the meeting room to change an organization. I've been the CEO and
 Chairman in a number of companies, and I'm pretty good it.
 In situtions where there's a great opportunity and team and all you're
 missing is a CEO, I'm open to an interim-CEO position.
In this capcity I will manage the milestones, develop the team & culture and recruit my replacement.
