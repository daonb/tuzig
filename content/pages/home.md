## Benny Daon

Hi. I'm Benny from Tel-Aviv, father to Noya(13) and Daniella(7) and married to
Libby.  I've been coding since the 8bit days and I'm Tuzig's founder and owner.
I've coded in Basic, 6502, Pl/1, Cobol, Fortran, Turbo Pascal, Pl/1, Ada,
Fortran, C, C++, Java, javascript and python which is the best.  I've been coding and
adminstrating Unix machines since 1990 and I grok Linux or at least its user
face. 
Currently free-lancing for matific, developing the core
of a massive Django project connecting students and teachers to
casual math games.
