services for agile projects and prefer to work for open source
projects.

Tuzig is currently developing a not-for-profit project - Open Knesset for
the Twenty Knesset. We are partnering with MKs and their teams to develop a
service that will strengthen the relationship between them and the
activists. The plan is to have a crowd funding campaign by the end of
May, so we're going to take on a new project in June 2015.
