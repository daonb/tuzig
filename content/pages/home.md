Tuzig Limited is me, Benny Daon.  Tuzig is my commercial avatar and the
channel through which I sell my services. I provide web and mobile strategy,
development and design solutions for both non-profit and for-profit
organizations as well.

I prefer to spend my time in front of VIM as I enjoy coding and it's
the most effective way to use my time. I am a full stack developer who
prefer scenario based design and test driven development. I am also a very
active open source contributor and I grok open communities.

groking both AngularJS and servers However, rarely in the life of an
organization it's more effective to lead from the meeting room.
When a startup just starts or goes through startegic inflaction points I can
be more effective , when it's easy to
develop a better system.
