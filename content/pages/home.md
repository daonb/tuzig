> Working with Benny for the last year has brought back my faith in
> developers who understand product. Apart from the coding part, in which he
> excels, it was a sheer pleasure getting hammered on the head by him, with
> product insights I've missed. Benny is fully dedicated to our project and
> brings to the table levels of energy that every workplace wants.
