I'm a 1969 Vintage Benny from the Daon family. I lives in Tel-Aviv with my wife and two daughters: Noya
and Daniella.

Coding is my hobby for over 30 years. My first computer was an Atari 400 and my first professional gig was in
Israeli Air Force, maintaining the fortran code for the F16 flight simulator.

Two weeks after my discharge in 1992 I went for a big trip.
I travelled by train across eastern europe and through kazakhstan into
eastern china. I ended the Trip in Goa by the Indian Ocean from
where I flew home after four months of travel by land and sea and seeing
the everest close by

When I came back, I started working as a junior developer
for a startup - Rad Advanced Networks. In RUN we tried to improve TCP's
flow control and optimize available bandwidth. While there, I learned what
the network looks like at the packet level, working on a network sniffer
for most of the day.

RAN collapsed in late 1997 driving me to start working on a testing tool
RAN needed badly - a WAN emulator. A tool that all testing traffic flows
through and that lets the user recreate effects of the global network in
his lab.

Around this idea, we've bootstraped Shunra Software with me as the CEO.
It took us six months to make the first product sale and 7 years
 of profitable growth to have 60 employees.
We finally raised $11.5MM from Jeff and Harel (reping Insight
Venture Partners and Carmel Ventures) and a year after the investment
I felt it's time to move on, left Shunra and sold my shares.

After making a fool of myself and burning some money on the second startup,
I retired from the busines world and went back to coding focusing on
