Title: About
Author: Benny Daon

I am a software craftsman who understands agile development and the
importance of automated testing and documentation.
I am a "full stack" developer, good at coding a frontend using
frameworks like AngularJS, and I can code DevOps tools based on tools like
Docker.  I love Python and Javascript and know very little about SQL and a lot about data networks.

I've started coding after my Bar-Mitzva in Basic and 8 bit assembler and
I still enjoy coding, more than 30 years later.  In late 1997 I
co-founded Shunra Software - a bootstrap - and led the development of
its first product: `The Cloud`.

I've been fortunate enough to lead Shunra as its CEO in its first seven
years and help it grow to a yearly income of $10MM and over 60
employees. Thanks to my Shunra's shares, I've been able to take it easy
in the last seven years getting back on the coding saddle and developing
open-source, creative-common projects.

Ofri and I started Open Knesset in 2009 and today it is
the leading source of parliementry data. In 2011, Open Knesset gave
birth to a mother non-profit organization - `The Public
Knowledge Workshop` or `Hasadna` for its short Hebrew name.
