      <div><p>I guess things aren&rsquo;t that simple and easy at github at the moment.  I&rsquo;m watching it all from over 7,000 miles away and I believe I can feel the founders&rsquo; and their families pains.</p>

<p>While we all want rapid growth, we tend to forget that growing at a ridiculous speed is impossible to manage.  Some are lucky, and become the billion-users-behemoth while most have a tougher ride.  It is like riding a crazy five years roller coaster enabling you to develop property worth over $100MM.</p>

<p>Personally, it&rsquo;s very stressful to be a founder at such an endeavor.   It changes your live.  It makes your family and friends look at you differently, re-labeling you and taking you out of context.  You find yourself in a new place and it&rsquo;s very stressful. As Newman said: &ldquo;the mail never stops coming&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s even more stressful for the spouses.  Being at the passenger seat of this wild ride they help with navigation.  Sponses role is never  formal gut it&rsquo;s a good thing they are involved.  IMO, it&rsquo;s a good thing for a founder to be able to talk to their spouses and listen to their advice.</p>

<p>I was sorry to read the latest posts coming from github and I want to thank all github founders and their families for a great service to me and to the open source community.</p>

<p>Social Coding FTW!</p></div>
